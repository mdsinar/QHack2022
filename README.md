# QHack2022

This repo contains team Falcon's codes for the QHack 2022 challenge.
In this event, we were given 25 problem sets to be solved using Pennylane.
Our team was able to finish all 25 problems, which placed us at 39th place (based on how fast you upload your answer) out of over 500 contestants.
